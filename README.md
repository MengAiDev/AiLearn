# AiLearn - My AI Learning Project

This repository contains my projects and experiments as I learn about artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Thanks for the bilibili video: https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1VZMLzMEUY

## Projects: 
1. Linear Regression Demo
This demo shows a simple linear regression model using scikit-learn on the diabetes dataset.

### Files
- `linear_regression_demo.py`: Python script implementing the linear regression model
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for the project

### Usage
Run: 
```sh
cd linear_regression && pip install -r requirements.txt && python linear_regression_demo.py
```

2. Logistic Regression Iris Demo
This demo shows a logistic regression model for iris flower classification using scikit-learn.

### Files
- `logistic_regression_demo_iris_classification.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing the logistic regression model
- `requirements.txt`: Dependencies for the project

### Usage
Run:
```sh
cd logistic_regression_iris && pip install -r requirements.txt && jupyter notebook logistic_regression_demo_iris_classification.ipynb
```

3. Logistic Regression Exam Demo
This demo shows a logistic regression model to predict exam pass/fail based on Exam1 and Exam2 scores, comparing linear and quadratic decision boundaries.

### Files
- `logistic_regression_demo_exam.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook implementing the logistic regression model
- `examdata.csv`: Dataset containing exam scores and pass/fail results

### Usage
Run:
```sh
cd logistic_regression_exam && jupyter notebook logistic_regression_demo_exam.ipynb
```

4. 2D Data Cluster Classifier Demo  
This project demonstrates clustering and classification algorithms on 2D data, including KMeans, KNN, MeanShift, and DBSCAN, with visualization and accuracy evaluation.

#### Files
- `2Ddata_cluster classifier/demo.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with code and visualizations
- `2Ddata_cluster classifier/data.csv`: Example dataset (not included, user should provide)
- `2Ddata_cluster classifier/README.md`: Project-specific instructions

#### Usage
Run:
```sh
cd "2Ddata_cluster classifier" && jupyter notebook demo.ipynb
```
See the project README for details on requirements and usage.
